# gas-properties
GUI to simply and easily calculate gas properties using cantera. 

This program was created when I tried to help someone with a problem by having them install 
GasEq (Chris Morley, http://www.gaseq.co.uk/).
GasEq is a very useful GUI program for calculating gas-phase thermochemistry properties for those who are not comfortable with 
more advanced tools such as cantera and chemkin. Unfortunately, I found that GasEq is no longer supported with modern 
operating systems.

So, I set out to build a simple GUI in python that has similar functionality to GasEq


Installation:
This program is written for python 3. Install it via www.python.org.
For a more user-friendly installation experience that includes many dependencies, install Anaconda: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
This program also depends on cantera. See http://www.cantera.org/docs/sphinx/html/install.html for installation instructions
